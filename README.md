# 3-Tier Highly Available AWS Cloud Architecture for Web Hosting
This project covered the architectural design of a HA, scalable and fault tolerant 3-tier architecture.

Below is a detailed breakdown of each of the Three-tiers, along with their respective services in each tier. 
## Presentation Tier

## Logic Tier
