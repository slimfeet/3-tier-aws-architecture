# 3-Tier Highly Available AWS Cloud Architecture for Web Hosting
This project covered the architectural design of a HA, scalable and fault tolerant 3-tier architecture. As simple as it looks, this architecture pre-provisions resources prior to actual usage, while having the flexibility of tearing down unhealthy or un-needed infrastructure components when not needed.
